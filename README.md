# DieRoller
A simple library for programmatically calculating probabilities and simulating scenarios of the rolling of a single die.

A scenario will include the initial die roll and may perform a reroll or have the roll result modified.

This library is a generic tool that generally follows the rules set out by 40k, but with no actual tie to the rule set of 40k.
